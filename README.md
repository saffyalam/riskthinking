# riskthinking

Create a Dockerfile that contains the necessary commands to build a Docker image for the workflow. Here's an example Dockerfile:


Copy code
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the required packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the entire repository into the container at /app
COPY . .

# Define the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["python", "riskthinking_ai_solution2.py"]

We can use Python's built-in logging module to log the output of the pipeline as you can see on the code
